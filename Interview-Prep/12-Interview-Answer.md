# 01. Docker host is running out of disk space. How do you clean up?
- **Disk space issues with Docker are incredibly common in production, and I've dealt with several critical incidents where services went down 
  because the host ran out of space. The key is having both immediate response procedures and long-term prevention strategies.**


### My Immediate Response Protocol
- **When I get a disk space alert, my first action is assessment, not cleanup. I run:**
  ```
  docker system df -v
  df -h /var/lib/docker
  ```

- **This tells me exactly what's consuming space and helps me prioritize the cleanup strategy. In my experience, build cache is usually the biggest 
  culprit I've seen it consume 50GB+ on active CI/CD servers.**


# 02. Production War Stories
- **Let me share a critical incident from last year. Our main application server hit 98% disk usage during peak traffic. The immediate danger was 
  that Docker couldn't create new containers for auto-scaling.**

- **My emergency response was:**
  ```
  # Immediate space recovery - build cache is safest to remove
  docker builder prune -a -f  # Freed 8GB instantly
  
  # Then stopped containers (checked they weren't needed for debugging)
  docker container prune -f   # Another 3GB
  
  # Finally dangling images
  docker image prune -f       # 2GB more
  ```

- **This bought us enough space to get through the traffic spike, but the real lesson was implementing monitoring and automated cleanup.**

--------------------------------------------------------------

##### Another Real Scenario

- **We had a microservices environment where a developer's feature branch was creating hundreds of test images daily. Our CI/CD server filled up 
  and builds started failing.**

- **The root cause was poor image tagging strategy every branch build created a new 'latest' tag without cleaning old ones. My solution was
  implementing a retention policy:**
  ```
  # Automated cleanup script for CI servers
  #!/bin/bash
  # Keep only last 5 builds per branch, remove images older than 48h
  docker images --format "{{.Repository}}:{{.Tag}}" | \
  grep -E "feature-.*" | \
  sort | uniq -c | awk '$1 > 5 {print $2}' | \
  xargs -r docker rmi
  
  docker image prune -a --filter "until=48h" -f
  ```

- **This reduced our storage usage by 70% and prevented future incidents**


# 03. Advanced Production Considerations
- **In enterprise environments, I've learned to consider:
  a. Multi-tenant Docker hosts: Can't just nuke everything - need surgical cleanup
  b. Persistent volume data: Accidentally removing customer data is career-ending
  c. Container logs: Often overlooked but can grow to gigabytes per container
  d. Registry mirror caches: Can consume massive space if not managed
  e. Swarm/Kubernetes overhead: Orchestrator metadata and networking overlays**


# 04. My Systematic Approach
- **I follow a prioritized cleanup strategy:
  a. Build cache first - safest and usually biggest impact
  b. Stopped containers - after confirming no debugging needed
  c. Dangling images - unreferenced layers
  d. Time-based cleanup - resources older than retention policy
  e. Manual review - large images that might be unused**


# 05. Prevention Strategies I've Implemented
- **Based on these experiences, I've established:
  a. Automated daily cleanup via cron jobs on all Docker hosts
  b. Docker daemon log rotation configuration to prevent log file bloat
  c. CI/CD pipeline hygiene with automatic image cleanup after successful deployments
  d. Monitoring and alerting at 70% disk usage with auto-cleanup at 85%
  e. Multi-stage Dockerfile standards to minimize final image sizes**


# 06. Team Processes and Documentation
- **I've created runbooks for different scenarios:
  a. Emergency procedures for critical disk space situations
  b. Maintenance schedules for regular cleanup during low-traffic windows
  c. Incident response protocols including when to involve different team members
  d. Capacity planning guidelines for provisioning Docker hosts**


# 07. Advanced Monitoring Setup
- **In production, I monitor:**
  ```
  # Custom script that runs every 15 minutes
  DOCKER_USAGE=$(df /var/lib/docker | awk 'NR==2{print $5}' | sed 's/%//')
  if [ $DOCKER_USAGE -gt 80 ]; then
      # Alert DevOps team
      # Log detailed breakdown
      docker system df -v >> /var/log/docker-space.log
      # Auto-cleanup if above 90%
      if [ $DOCKER_USAGE -gt 90 ]; then
          docker system prune -f --volumes=false  # Preserve data
      fi
  fi
  ```


# 08. Key Insights from Experience
- **The most important lessons I've learned:
  a. Build cache is your friend and enemy - great for performance, terrible for disk usage if not managed
  b. Container logs are silent killers - they grow continuously and are often forgotten
  c. Developer education is crucial - most space issues come from poor image building practices
  d. Automation is essential - manual cleanup doesn't scale and creates single points of failure
  e. Always preserve data volumes - losing customer data is worse than temporary service disruption**
