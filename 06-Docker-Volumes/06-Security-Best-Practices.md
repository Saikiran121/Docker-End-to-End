# 01. Best Practices
      a. Always run containers as non-root users with proper volume ownership

      b. Mount volumes as read-only unless write access is absolutely necessary

      c. Use named volumes instead of bind mounts for production workloads

      d. Implement proper file permissions (avoid 777 or world-writable)

      e. Enable security modules like SELinux, AppArmor, or seccomp

      f. Encrypt sensitive volume data both at rest and in transit

      g. Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning

      h. Monitor volume access patterns for anomalous behavior

      i. Use dedicated secrets management instead of storing secrets in volumes

      j. Keep Docker and host systems updated with latest security patches
